# Advent of Code

My attempt at the [2022 Advent of Code Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/), created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).

## Day One (1/12/22)

Calorie concious elves, all good fun.

## Day Two (2/12/22)

I think I made my solution way more complicated than it needed to be, probably still is... I eventually realised that I could use the same logic across parts 1 and 2, with the only change being to the `scoreMap` value - refactored to reflect this. Funny story, today I inadvertantly triggered the [Google Foobar Challenge](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/) whilst researching something for this challenge! I gave part one a go but eventually spat my dummy out when I couldn't get two of the hidded tests to pass. I also tried some [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) today and will keep at it with upcoming challenges.
